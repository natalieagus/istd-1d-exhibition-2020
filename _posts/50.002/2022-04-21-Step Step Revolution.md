### Description


Step Step Revolution intends to test its players on both their memory and coordination skills with the goal being to clear as many rounds as possible. To do so, a sequence of LED lights will light up and the player must memorise them and re-enter them into the machine within 30 seconds to advance to the next round. There are a total of 10 such rounds. The project was made with 5 LED arcade buttons, a single plastic button, 2 4 digit 7-segment displays and an Alchitry Au FPGA. The rest of the materials excluding those used for wired connection were repurposed from other scrap material.
