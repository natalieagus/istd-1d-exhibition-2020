### Description

Tik Tok Toe RTX 2000 introduces a unique twist to the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The crosses and circles are replaced with squares of distinct colours and sizes. Each player can play up to 2 pieces of three varied sizes: Small, medium and large. Here is when the fun begins! Bigger pieces can usurp the smaller pieces from their place on the grid. As the number of pieces for each size provided is limited, players must think critically and strategically to anticipate their opponent's next move and achieve a decisive victory.

Players need not worry about having to learn new and complex rules that would dampen the fun. Our game maintains the fundamental concept of Tic-Tac-Toe: Form a line across the 3-by-3 grid and win the game or force a draw otherwise.
Players only have to interact with a simple keypad to play the entire game. The game’s retro-style display, a 16x16 LED matrix, is set in a welcoming wooden casing that is pleasing to the eye. All the information about the game, namely the current player’s turn, the number of pieces for both Players 1 and 2 and the game itself, is always displayed on the LED matrix.
